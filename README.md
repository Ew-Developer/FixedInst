# FixedInst
Makes all your parts created with Instance.new have godmode.

# How to use
Your script needs to have http access and loadstring to use this in one line
```lua
local Instance,_Instance = loadstring(game:GetService("HttpService"):GetAsync("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ew-Developer/FixedInst/main/src/main.lua"))()
```

If you dont have http acces or dont have loadstring access, you can apply the source of FixedInst to your project. But you have to remove the return in it.
You can find the source at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ew-Developer/FixedInst/main/src/main.lua
